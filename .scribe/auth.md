# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer Bearer {YOUR_AUTH_KEY}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

After logging in, copy your API token and paste it here as: <b>Bearer YOUR_TOKEN</b>.
